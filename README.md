 User Roles and Permissions
The system was designed to support two types of users:

Administrator (admin)

Regular User (user)

âœ… Admin Capabilities
Had full access to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) any user and their associated permissions.

Could view all users, regardless of their type.

ðŸ‘¤ Regular User Capabilities
Could only view users of their same type (i.e., other regular users).

No access to user creation, modification, or deletion features.

ðŸ”„ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The existing login flow was extended to implement role-based access. After a successful login (valid username and password), the system granted or restricted feature access dynamically based on the authenticated user's role.

ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Feature
Each user's dashboard displays the username of the currently logged-in user in the top-right corner of the interface for contextual awareness.
